# Project 2: Shiny App Development
### App folder

The App directory contains the app files for our Shiny App. `global.R` sets ui and data connection standards, `ui.R` and `styles.css` specify styling and ui design. `gomap.js` allows for connectivity between our datatable and maps. `server.R` contains the main code of our app.
